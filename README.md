# CCFD

This project contain the model that predict fraud credict card operations.
The dataset Credit Card Fraud Detection(CCFD) is taken from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Data description from Kaggle:
"The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. 
The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. 
Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. 
Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. 
Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. 
The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. 
Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise."

Thus the project allows to classify credit card operations and identify fraud operations. The trick of this dataset is that it have extremely unbalanced target data.
Credit Card Frauds Detection.ipynb file show my thoughts during this project constrution, it contains some EDA on the data.
The project by itself contain a little Flask API.
